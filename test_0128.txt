1. "items left" incorrectly counts rows. If all rows are checked, it shows "-1".

2. "active" is written in lowercase, while the other buttons are in uppercase.

3. "Select" button works incorrectly: clicking once marks all rows as done, 
when clicking a second time, the button only changes color,
when clicking a third time, all rows are marked as uncompleted again.

4. A new entry is added to the end of the list. 
   When the list is long, you may not see whether the entry has been added, you need to scroll to check.
